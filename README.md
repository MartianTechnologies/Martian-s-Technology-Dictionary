Summary

One of the biggest problems in Intelligence studies is the association of semantics and syntax. Indeed, the field spans various domains and industries like physics, computer science, mathmatics, and psychology. Across these different disciplines words often have different meanings. As a result, interdisciplinary communication is difficult, creating a barrier to effective collaboration. Martian's Technology Dictionary is my working solution to the problem.
